## Assignment Challenge
In this assignment, we create one of two possible computer games: Word Guess or Psychic. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.
- Word-Guess Essentially the classic game of "hangman" with a theme of your choice. In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!

## Technical Approach
- The challenges to this assignment using an implementing mutiple new concepts at the same time including:
  - Javascript in general
  - DOM Listeners
  - Basic user validation
  - Working with arrays
- A key learning from this exercise was working with arrays - 'map' and other methods were shown briefly in class and it took a bit to figure out how to implement them. 
- The solution utilized for this project drew strongly from 2 sources:
  - Seaworld's website for a 'theme'. The had a list of animals with facts,pictures and sound bites that in the 'next steps' would be linked to when the animal name was guessed correctly!
  - The book "Eloquent JavaScript" and specifically chapter 3's implementation of 'map'
